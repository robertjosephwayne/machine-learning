# Consider the case where a person is tested with a lie detector
# and gets a positive result suggesting that they are lying.
# What is the probability that the person is actually lying?

# Assumptions
# P(A) - 2% of people that are tested are lying
# P(B|A) - When someone is lying, the test can detect them 72% of the time
# P(not B|not A) - When the machine says someone is not lying, this is true 97% of the time
